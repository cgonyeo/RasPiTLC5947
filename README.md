RasPiTLC5940
============

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE, AND DOESN'T WORK AS INTENDED.

A small C program that can control the TLC5947 chip from TI with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi

You need to have the WiringPi library installed. It's available at:
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/

This program requires use of four of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. The required pins are specified in tlc5947.c
